otupdate.common.name_management: functions for managing machine names

The robot has several names associated with it, some of which we tie together.


- The static hostname:

  This is the traditional computer networking hostname,
  which has limits on length and allowed characters.

  Avahi automatically advertises this over mDNS,
  so it can be used to ping, issue HTTP requests, ssh in, etc.,
  via <static hostname>.local.


- The Avahi service name:

  This is a human-readable Unicode string.
  It affects how the system is advertised over mDNS + DNS-SD.
  Network exploration tools may use it as a user-facing label.

  The DNS-SD spec calls this the "instance name".
  (This is not to be confused with what the DNS-SD spec calls the "service name",
  which is a totally separate thing.)


- The pretty hostname:

  A human-readable Unicode string.
  This is a systemd thing, stored in /etc/machine-info as the PRETTY_HOSTNAME
  and accessible via tools like hostnamectl.


- "The name" (unqualified):

  Over HTTP, we let clients get and set the robot's "name," a human-readable
  Unicode string.

  Behind the scenes, this is implemented in terms of setting other names.
  See `set_name_endpoint()`.
